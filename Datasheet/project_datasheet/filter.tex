\label{sec::filter}

The decimation filter generates the clock needed by the microphones from the system clock and processes the received bitstreams.
It is widely configurable by generic parameters at compile time as well as by software. 
It outputs filtered and decimated signed values and an interrupt to indicate when new values are available.
Low-pass filtering and decimation is done by a CIC filter of up to third order with programmable decimation factor.
An additional high-pass IIR filter with configurable pole location can be added to block potential DC-components due to offsets.
